- Converted the Typing Manager into a Prefab, which can be reused in any scene. Certain objects need to be reattached in
	every scene, like the Rect Transform of certain objects. The Load Next Scene script also requires the user to 
	name the scene it's supposed to load every time the prefab is used in a scene.

- Also added a Scene Loader script. The purpose was to organize all the scene loading functions into one script, and then
	reference its contained functions whenever necessary. 

- Created a Main Menu that lets the player start the game, see the credits and also lets them exit the game.

- Deleted the GameOver Script and moved its functions into the SceneManager Script.

- Erased the AudioManager Script and moved the AudioClip Array to the Typing Manager script. It takes an array of audio
	clips and then loads them one by one into an audio source attached to the Typing Manager Prefab. 
	
	NOTE: The game will not let the player type anything once the AudioClip array has run out of lines to play.
	In order to be able to test the game without any voicelines, the NarratorVoiceLines array needs to have an index
	equal to that of the sentence array from the Sentence Splitter Script.

- Added an if-Statement that will load the next level when a certain no. of notes have been hit by the player in a single
	combo.

- Converted the PLayer Object into a Prefab

- Converted the Rhythm Manager into a Prefab.
